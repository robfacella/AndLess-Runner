# AndLess\ Runner

A game... sort of.
Testing repo for Android porting from Unity

----

Endless Runner, single button gameplay; warning about not being 
signed in, search the error, something to do with Orginization 
settings, not Unity Account rather Company Info. Built 18mb APK file in about 5mins.
USB transfered to SSG, security warnings, install anyway.
WORKS. Needs screen rotated to actually see the player though.

Google Play Store, or rather the Google Play Console, requires a 25$ 
registration fee. Will have to look more into that distribution channel, 
but not worth doing untilI've built something more worth marketing.
